# Riverport Baseball League

**"Relive the glory days... one pulled hamstring at a time."**

Welcome to the Riverport Sandlot, where the only thing higher than the home run count is the average BMI.

## How to Play

### Controls
*   **Mouse:** Aim your bat or pitch.
*   **Click:** Swing (Batting) or Start Pitch Meter (Pitching).

### Game Rules (Sandlot Showdown)
1.  **3 Innings:** You play against the "Uptown Yuppies". High score wins.
2.  **Batting:**
    *   Move mouse to aim the reticle.
    *   Click when the ball is in the zone.
    *   Timing determines power. Aim determines direction.
3.  **Pitching:**
    *   Click once to start the power meter.
    *   Click again to set accuracy.
    *   Don't walk them!
4.  **Running:**
    *   Running is automatic, but your players are... past their prime.
    *   **Stamina System:** Every sprint or hard swing drains stamina. Low stamina means slower running and weaker hits.
    *   *Tip:* Don't try to stretch a single into a double if your knees are bad.

## The "Washouts"
Each player is procedurally generated with unique stats:
*   **Power:** How hard they hit (often correlates with belly size).
*   **Speed:** How fast they run (inversely correlated with age and knees).
*   **Knees:** A hidden stat that affects injury chance.

Enjoy the game, and remember to ice your shoulder afterwards!
