# Mine Maze

**Mine Maze** is a grid-based puzzle game where you reveal tiles to collect treasure while avoiding mines, all within a limited number of moves.

## Rules
*   **Goal:** Maximize your score by collecting treasures.
*   **Moves:** You start with 24 moves. Revealing a tile costs 1 move.
*   **Mines:** Revealing a mine ends the run immediately (and penalizes score).
*   **Hints:** Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that tile.
*   **Treasures:** Reveal tiles with gems to score points.
*   **Winning:** Survive until moves run out or you decide to stop (feature coming soon). Currently, runs end when moves hit 0.

## Controls
*   **Left Click / Tap:** Reveal a tile.
*   **Right Click / Long Press:** Flag a suspected mine.

## Scoring
*   Treasures have varying values.
*   Hitting a mine halves your accumulated score.
*   Daily leaderboards track the highest scores for the same seed.
